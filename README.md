I created a predictive analytics project that applied predictive modeling (linear regression) using R and Excel to describe relationships in my data, which comprised 6 unique variables with differing relationships to my primary variable of income.

I proceeded to separate my data into training and testing partitions, and included proposals for 5 different linear regression models that are involved in predicting the same y‐variable based on hypothesized relationships that I found in the data.

Then, I generated predictions using the models I built, but used the testing data partition. I wanted to test each of my model candidates to find the one that performs the best out‐of‐sample on the test data, which was not used to build the model.

Lastly, I wrapped up my analysis with a conclusion and proposal of what I think is the best model to predict the variable of interest based off of my analysis and model comparison with my dataset.
